Java Git Implementation
=======================

Overview
--------

This project is a basic implementation of Git in Java, providing core Git functionality without relying on the Git command-line tool. It's designed for educational purposes to understand the inner workings of Git, demonstrating how Git manages objects, creates commits, and handles basic version control operations.

Project Goals
-------------

1.  Implement core Git commands in Java
    
2.  Provide a clear, readable codebase for learning about Git internals
    
3.  Demonstrate low-level operations like object hashing, tree traversal, and commit creation
    

Features
--------

This implementation supports the following Git commands:

*   init: Initialize a new Git repository
    
*   cat-file: Display the contents of a Git object
    
*   hash-object: Compute object ID and optionally create a blob from a file
    
*   ls-tree: List the contents of a tree object
    
*   write-tree: Create a tree object from the current index
    
*   commit-tree: Create a new commit object
    
*   clone: Clone a repository into a new directory
    

Technical Details
-----------------

### Object Storage

Git objects (blobs, trees, and commits) are stored in the .git/objects directory. Each object is compressed using zlib compression and named according to its SHA-1 hash.

### Object Types

1.  **Blob**: Represents file contents
    
2.  **Tree**: Represents directories and file names
    
3.  **Commit**: Represents a specific point in the project's history
    

### Hashing

SHA-1 hashing is used to generate unique identifiers for Git objects. This project implements SHA-1 hashing using Java's MessageDigest class.

### File I/O

The project uses Java NIO (java.nio.file) for efficient file operations, providing better performance and more flexible file handling compared to the older java.io package.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 14 or higher
    
*   Java compiler (javac)
    

Installation
------------

1.  git clone https://github.com/ArvindReddySheelam/Git-Clone
    
2.  cd Native-Git-Clone
    
3.  javac Main.java
    

Usage
-----

After compilation, you can run the program using the java command followed by GitImplementation and the Git command you want to execute. Here are some examples:

1.  java Main init
    
2.  java Main hash-object -w
    
3.  java Main cat-file -p
    
4.  java Main ls-tree --name-only
    
5.  java Main commit-tree \-p \-m "Commit message"
    
6.  java Main clone
    

Implementation Details
----------------------

### Command Execution

The Main method in the Main class serves as the entry point for all Git commands. It uses a switch statement to delegate to the appropriate method based on the command.

### Object Reading and Writing

*   hash_Object: Reads and decompresses a Git object from the object store.
    
*   ls_Tree: Compresses and writes a Git object to the object store.
    

### Tree Handling

The writeTreeObject method recursively creates tree objects for directories, while readTreeObject parses the binary format of tree objects.

### Commit Creation

The commitTree method assembles commit data, including tree hash, parent commit, author information, and commit message.

Limitations
-----------

This is a basic implementation and does not include all features of Git. Some limitations include:

*   No support for branches or tags
    
*   Limited error handling and edge case management
    
*   No index (staging area) management
    

It's meant for educational purposes and may not handle all the complex scenarios that the official Git implementation does.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

Potential areas for improvement include:

1.  Implementing branch and tag support
    
2.  Adding index management for staging changes
    
3.  Improving error handling and input validation
    
4.  Implementing more Git commands (e.g., merge, rebase)
    
5.  Adding support for config files and Git hooks
